    "The 6E1S structure contained the PreQ1 riboswitch backbone with two omitted residues (13 and 14). To ensure a representative simulation of the ligand bound to the PreQ1 riboswitch, a structure with the cognate metabolite bound to the PreQ1 riboswitch (PDB ID: 3Q50), which included all residues, was also obtained from Connelly et al. This complete structure was then aligned with the binding pose of Ligand 1 (6E1S) using PyMOL, resulting in an RMSD of 0.4 Å. This signified that there was considerable overlap between the metabolite and the ligand, with residue 13 positioned slightly closer to the ligand than to the metabolite. The metabolite and the incomplete backbone were subsequently removed in PyMOL leaving just Ligand 1 (PDB ID: 6E1S) and the complete PreQ1 riboswitch backbone (PDB ID: 3Q50). $SO_4^{2-}$, which was present in the structure due to the crystallization and purification processes, was deleted using PyMOL as it is not typically observed under physiological conditions. The PreQ1 backbone and Ligand 1 were then protonated using PDBFixer and Open Babel (version 3.0.0) respectively. Since no parameters for the PreQ1 riboswitch were available in the AMBER GAFF2 force field, the PreQ1 backbone and the crystal structure waters were parameterized following the methodology of Hashem et al.<sup>5</sup> using tleap prior to loading.\n",
