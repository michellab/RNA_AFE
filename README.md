# RNA_AFE: Molecular Dynamics Simulations Setup and Analysis for Small Molecule-RNA Complexes

## Introduction

__The notebooks included on this page cover the necessary steps to setup, run and analyse Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Small Molecule-RNA complexes:__

* Loading, parameterising, solvating and combining the Ligands, the RNA and the Waters.
* Running Equilibration and Minimisation for the Small Molecule:RNA system.
* Writing scripts to initiate 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations using various simulation engines.
* Analysing MD simulations and producing plots for reports.
